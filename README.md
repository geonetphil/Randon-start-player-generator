# Player Picker

Selects a person randomly, inspired by Chwazi. [Try it out on a touch-enabled device](https://geonetphil.github.io/player-picker/).

There are a number of ways to select board game players in certain scenarios and some methods can be fun and quirky: The person with the pointiest ears, for example, gets to start in [Small World](https://www.daysofwonder.com/smallworld/en/). However, in other situations, you just want to get the job done and focus on the more enjoyable parts of a game. The Player Picker web app makes the process of selecting a person quick by eliminating the need to install a native app.
